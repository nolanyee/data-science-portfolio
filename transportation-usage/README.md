# Transportation Usage Forecasting
*Skills: R, Visualization, Time Series Analysis, Nonlinear Regression*

This project involves predicting the number of passengers on a new transit system based on historical data. The series is decomposed as a multiplicative time series. The components are trend, seasonality, and remainder. The remainder component is stationary and thus is modeled with ARIMA. The trend is modeled using nonlinear regression.

For more details, see the PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook. A PDF is included for faster loading and a more pleasant read since it displays without expanding all the output windows. For code and data reviewing purposes, the original Jupyter Notebook file is also included in this repository along with the datasets.
