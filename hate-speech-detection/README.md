# Twitter Hate Speech Detection
*Skills: Python, Natural Language Processing, Feature Extraction, Algorithms, Machine Learning*

The goal of this project is to classify tweets as normal or hate speech (defined vaguely as being either racist or sexist). The training set is already labeled (method of training set labeling is unknown and may be biased). Classification models aim to label the test set based on the training set labels. This project notably includes a custom depth first search algorithm for splitting a hashtag into individual words. It also includes a dictionary-based algorithm to perform faster searches in a long sorted word list based on the first two letters of the word.

For more details, see the PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook. A PDF is included for faster loading and a more pleasant read since it displays without expanding all the output windows. For code and data reviewing purposes, the original Jupyter Notebook file is also included in this repository along with the datasets.
