# Titanic Survival Prediction
*Skills: Python, Feature Extraction, Imputation, Visualization, Machine Learning, Feature Selection*

The purpose of this project is to create a model that predicts whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on passenger information. Feature extraction and imputation make up a large portion of the work. Specifically, the name feature is used to generate many features including ethnicity, marital status, and profession. The larger set of features helps in imputation of missing values.

For more details, see the PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook. A PDF is included for faster loading and a more pleasant read since it displays without expanding all the output windows. For code and data reviewing purposes, the original Jupyter Notebook file is also included in this repository along with the datasets.
