# Data Science Portfolio

This repository is a portfolio of all my self-study projects and other coding side projects. It contains Jupyter Notebooks using Python or R, as well as scripts/applications written in Python. The repository has a subfolder for each project, containing the code in .ipynb files or .py files, as well as relevant data sets. For quick perusal, the links below point to README files or PDF versions of the Jupyter Notebook. 

The projects focus on solving interesting and diverse problems using a variety of different techniques.

# Contents

## Unstructured Data Analysis and Processing

* Image Processing
  * [Depth Map Generator](depth-map-generator/README.md): Generates normal maps and depth maps from monocular images of  monochromatic matte bas-reliefs. The application is primarily for use in texturing 3D models. This program uses physical and mathematical approaches to solve this challenging problem.\
  *Skills: Python, Image Processing, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Visualization*
  
  * [Style Transfer Implementation](style-transfer/README.md): Inputs an image of a painting and a photograph, and applies the painting style to the photograph using a pre-trained convolutional neural network. This is an implementation of L. A. Gatys, A. S. Ecker, M. Bethge. Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.\
