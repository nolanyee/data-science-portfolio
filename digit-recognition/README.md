# Handwritten Digit Recognition
*Skills: Python, Image Recognition, Neural Networks*

The goal of this project is to create a model classify grayscale 28 x 28 pixel images of handwritten digits. The final model used for prediction is a simple feedforward neural network with two hidden layers.

For more details, see the PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook. A PDF is included for faster loading and a more pleasant read since it displays without expanding all the output windows. For code and data reviewing purposes, the original Jupyter Notebook file is also included in this repository along with the datasets.
