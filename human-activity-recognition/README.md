# Human Activity Recognition
*Skills: R, Machine Learning*

This project classifies samples into one of six possible activities based on features extracted from motion sensors. The data set contains 561 features which were calculated from time series data from the waist sensor. The data represents 6 possible human activities, walking, walking up stairs, walking down stairs, sitting, standing, and lying (coded as numbers 1-6 respectively).

For more details, see the PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook. A PDF is included for faster loading and a more pleasant read since it displays without expanding all the output windows. For code and data reviewing purposes, the original Jupyter Notebook file is also included in this repository along with the datasets.
