# Iris Classification
*Skills: Python, Visualization, Machine Learning*

This project is an evaluation of common machine learning algorithms on the classic Iris data set. The model is intended to classify an iris into 3 possible species based on the width and length of the sepal and petal. Linear Discriminant Analysis was the best performing algorithm during repeated cross-validation.

For more details, see the PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook. A PDF is included for faster loading and a more pleasant read since it displays without expanding all the output windows. For code and data reviewing purposes, the original Jupyter Notebook file is also included in this repository along with the datasets.
