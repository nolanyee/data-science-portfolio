# Movie Recommender Model
*Skills: Python, Linear Algebra, Feature Extraction, Optimization, Visualization*

In this project, a custom recommender model is developed and optimized using a 1 million movie rating dataset from MovieLens. The model is a weighted combination of collaborative filtering and content-based models. A combination of demographic data, movie genre, and latent factors extracted using non-negative matrix factorization are used to calculate custom similarity functions. 

For more details, see the PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook. A PDF is included for a more pleasant read since it displays without expanding all the output windows. For code and data reviewing purposes, the original Jupyter Notebook file is also included in this repository along with the datasets.
