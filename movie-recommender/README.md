# Movie Recommender Model

In this project, a custom recommender model is develped and optimized using a 1 million movie rating dataset from MovieLens. The model is a weighted combination of collaborative filtering and content-based models. A combintation of demographic data, movie genre, and latent factors extracted using non-negative matrix factorization are used to calculate custom similarity functions.

A PDF of the Jupyter Notebook is included for a more pleasant read since it displays without expanding all the output windows. For code and data reviewing purposes, the original Jupyter Notebook file is also included in this repository along with the datasets.
