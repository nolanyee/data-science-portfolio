*Skills: R, Visualization, Machine Learning*

The purpose of this project is to predict whether a loan will be approved based on the demographics of the person requesting the loan. This is a classification problem.

For more details, see the PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook. A PDF is included for faster loading and a more pleasant read since it displays without expanding all the output windows. For code and data reviewing purposes, the original Jupyter Notebook file is also included in this repository along with the datasets.
